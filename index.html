                      At Shore GmbH, I led a dedicated team in the development of a calendar app integrated into a <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</abbr> web application,
                      designed to offer digital solutions for local service providers. A significant part of my role involved overhauling
                      and modernizing the frontend infrastructure and managing a substantial legacy codebase. I was also an advocate for
                      development best practices, helping colleagues embrace tools like vim and methodologies such as test-driven development
                      and functional programming.
